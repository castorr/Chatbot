## Messages show in console/chatbot but not stream chat   
You most likely connected the bot to the wrong channel.  
1. Go to connections (the human silhuette in the bottom left corner)  
2. Go into bot connection  
3. Make sure Streamer Channel is the same as your actual stream name  

## Songrequest by artist/name
To enable this feature go into the `Songrequest` tab in the bot then press the `gear icon` in the top right corner and change `mode` from `$id` to either of the two other options

## Songrequests on Spotify is playing random songs after the first one
The most likely reason for this is due to a new option in Spotify. You can disable this in Spotify under `edit` -> `preferences` -> `Advanced settings` -> `Autoplay` -> `Autoplay similar songs when your music ends`
